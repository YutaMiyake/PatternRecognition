<dir> "Normalized"
    [all the original size images (100x100 pixels) separated by class;]

<dir> "3-fold Cross-Validation"
    [contains the cross-validation partitions of the two different
     sets (48x60 images in "48_60" dir and 16x20 images in "16_20" dir)]

    each of these directories contains:

    1. the gamma lookup table as a text file ("Gamma.lookup.txt")

    2. the pre-calculated eigenvectors (PCs_*.mat) and eigenvalues
       (EVs_*.mat) for each fold and the pre-calculated PCA projected
       data (*PCA_*.mat) for each fold (see "descr.txt" file) - you can
       use these files for your GAs in order to save time since you won't
       have to do the PCA projection yourself

    3. the images separated by fold, set and class (i.e. tr_XX, val_XX and
       ts_XX contain the training, validation and test images respectively
       for fold XX).
